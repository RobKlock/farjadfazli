### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in network operations and system administration. 

In recent years I have seen support roles in IT (like the one's I've had) get outsourced and/or automated. So I decided to pivot into the engineering side of things for more opportunities where I could continue to learn and grow.

I enjoy traveling, hiking, and all things nature!
